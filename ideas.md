<h2>Angry Birds bot</h2>

Make computer vision to spot pigs on the map
(since the pigs' models vary quite a bit, it is easier to detect using color matching)

TODO:<br>
Simulate mouse movement to be able to shoot the birds

Determine trajectory based on distance of mouse from slingshot and angle 

Determine when to use a power (Ex. when to explode the bomb guy) - maybe figure out how fast the birds travel and click based on how far away the structure is

Determine which bird to use based on the material of the structure
